# Sprint 1
## Goals for this sprint:
* Have a conceptual design of our database, illustrated by an ERD
* Find a source of data to use - open source data online? Create our own example data?
* Have a SQL database set up in our repository with tables

## ERD
ERD for our VPN Route Management System:

The actual ERD file can be viewed on [draw.io](draw.io) by selecting GitHub as the storage and selecting this repo and diagram.

## Data Source

## SQL Database
We have created a [script](https://github.com/macsyd/csc370-database-project/blob/main/VPNManagement.sql) which sets up a MySQL database with tables corresponding to our ERD. The tables are shown here:
