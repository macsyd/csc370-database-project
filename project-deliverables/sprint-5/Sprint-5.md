# Sprint 5
## Goals for this sprint
**Competency:** *"Preserves FD's: Checks if a decomposition preserves FD's and decomposes into third normal form (3NF) when appropriate"* <br>
* Check if all the functional dependencies in our ERD are preserved in our database which is in BCNF
* Decompose our database into 3NF if appropriate

**Competency:** *"Preserves MVD's: Checks if a decomposition preserves multi-value dependencies (MVD's) and decomposes into 4NF when appropriate"* <br>
* Check if all multi-valued dependencies are preserved in our database
* Decompose our database into 4NF if appropriate

**Competency:** *"Simplifies queries: Simplifies a complex query by converting a sub-query into a (outer?) join"* <br>
* If possible, simplify our earlier queries (in [DemoQueries.sql](project-deliverables/sprint-2/DemoQueries.sql)) that used sub-queries by potentially converting them into a join

**Competency:** *"Uses triggers: Enforces consistency by adding triggers to queries"* <br>
* Write queries that use triggers to enforce consistency

**Competency:** *"Embraces ternary logic: Incorporate NULL's into queries with ternary predicate logic"* <br>
* Write queries using NULL values and use ternary predicate logic to predict results

## Progress on goals
### 3NF

### 4NF

### Simplifying queries

### Using triggers

### Queries with NULL values

## Future Work
### Improvement to meet module level-competencies
**Competency:** *"Preserves FD's: Checks if a decomposition preserves FD's and decomposes into third normal form (3NF) when appropriate"* <br>
* Further exploration into whether all our FDs are preserved correctly and determine the best way to preserve the initiates relationship between Requests and Routes.
