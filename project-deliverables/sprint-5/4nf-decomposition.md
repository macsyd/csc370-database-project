## Multi-valued Dependencies (MVDs)
Our database has no MVDs in it - there are no attributes that would have more than one possible value when the rest of the tuple's values stay the same.

## 4NF
As our database is in BCNF and has no MVDs, it is trivially already in 4NF and there are no further decompositions we can do.
