# Sprint 3
## Goals for this sprint
### Plan to meet module-level competencies:
**Competency:** *“Manages access: Manages data access with users for whom privileges are set and revoked”* <br>
* Add example users to our database and manage their access by giving them specific privileges.
* Attempt to run queries that the user does not have privileges for and observe how our database prevents this from happening (success criteria is 100% of these queries should fail).

**Competency:** *"Creates views: Creates a view with privileges and inserts or deletes from base table"* <br>
* Create views within our database.

**Competency:** *"Ensures atomicity: Ensures atomicity by batching queries into transactions"* <br>
* Write transactions that batch queries together.

**Competency:** *"Enforces consistency: Enforces consistency with check constraints and assertions"* <br>
* Enforce consistency on our database and attempt to run queries that violate our schema to observe how well our database handles this (success criteria is 100% of these queries should fail).

**Competency:** *"Isolates transactions: Analyses transactions to determine and set appropriate isolation levels"* <br>
* Write transactions and analyze them to determine the isolation levels which are appropriate
* Manually set isolation levels in our database

## Progress on goals this sprint
### Manage access
This sprint, 

### Create views

### Ensure atomicity

### Enforce consistency

### Isolate transactions

## Goals for next sprint (up to and including the first two lessons of Advanced Relational Design)
### Plan to meet module-level competencies:
**Competency:** *"Uses inheritance notions: Incorporates inheritance and weak entity sets into database design"* <br>
* Add inheritance and weak entity sets to our ERD and implement those changes in our database by updating or adding tables where necessary

**Competency:** *"Evaluates quality: Evaluates an ERD with respect to a canonical set of design principles"* <br>
* Assess quality of our ERD according to the methods and principles discussed in class
* Report quality of our ERD according to these standards
* Update our ERD to improve quality if applicable

**Competency:** *"Connects conceptual-logical: Reads FD's out of an ERD and reverse engineers relations to an ERD"* <br>
* Identify all FD's in our updated ERD and ensure they are implemented in our database

**Competency:** *"Simplifies FD's: Calculates a minimal basis for a set of FD's to ensure design simplicity"* <br>
* Calculate minimal basis for the set of FD's in our ERD/database
* If the set of FD's in our ERD is not a minimal basis, simplify it to be one

**Competency:** *"Preserves FD's: Checks if a decomposition preserves FD's and decomposes into third normal form (3NF) when appropriate"* <br>
* 

**Competency:** *"Preserves MVD's: Checks if a decomposition preserves multi-value dependencies (MVD's) and decomposes into 4NF when appropriate"* <br>
* 

## Progress meeting course-level competencies:
**Data Analytics Competency:** *“Writes SQL code to generate desired effects on a relational database”* <br>
*
