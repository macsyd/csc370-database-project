# Goals for this sprint:
Develop a study plan for the course - do this by deciding on our project idea (what we want to build)
Demonstrate that we can define application and business requirements - do this by creating a list of requirements

### Database system:

## Requirements:
CRUD: Create a route, read the list of all routes, update a route, delete a route
User must be able to request the creation of a route
Admin must be able to review and approve requests (or modify before approval such as filling in missing information)
Option to add expiry date to a route

## Data needed:
Destination: The IP address of the internal service or network that you want to access through the VPN connection.
Examples: Web server, file server, database, or a network that all employee PCs and printers are connected to (adding an entire network saves time adding individual IP addresses and might be desired when the IP address could change within that networkâ€™s range of IP addresses)
Subnet/Network Mask
Gateway: Usually the IP address of the router.
Current route age and expiration date: An indication of how much time is left before the route is automatically deleted if an expiration date was assigned (helps with technical debt)
Owner: The contact person who is responsible for that device/service (maintainer or just the primary user of it)
Name/Description: What the route is for. Something all employees can comprehend without a technical background.
Admin: which users have admin privileges and what can they access

## Goals for next sprint (covering up to and including Basic Conceptual Design):
Have a conceptual design of our database, illustrated by an ERD
Find a source of data to use - open source data online? Create our own example data?
Have a SQL database set up in our repository with tables
